## Introduction

In this folder, we are reviewing, editing, and organizing the code originally written by Rose Wang for her student project. As part of this work, it is important to lay out what was done in an logical order that can be easily followed and reproduced. The goal is to abstract out the important parts of this work into part of a test case. A simplified view this part of the work is as follows:

1. Extract the data via the OpenAPI and construct a three way table. Identify any potential anomalies in the data. Complete a standard statistical analysis (TBD).

2. From behind the firewall, extract the binned data corresponding to Step 1. Complete the same statistical analysis.

3. From behind the firewall, extract the raw data corresponding to Step 1. Manually bin the data in order to do the standardized analysis.

4. Extract an set of "true" values from the statistical analysis of Step 3. Extract corresponding values from the analyses of Steps 2 and 3. Compare and contrast the results for "correctness".

5. Construct a test case that can be implemented in a standardized testing harness that validates the three way table paradigm.

6. Based on the results so far, propose an approach to identify potential failure points. Find one or more interesting failure points and implement test cases.

The test case we are going to work on first is for the three variables:

* `EDVisits` = Total ED/Inpatient Visits, 
* `MaxPMExposure` = Maximum Daily PM 2.5 Exposure (qcut), 
* `RoadwayExposure` = Major Roadway Highway Exposure.

## Extracting the data through the OpenAPI

We modified the code provided by Rose in `P(XYZ) Table.Rmd` to create data frames that contain the univariate, bivariate, and trivariate tables.

**File** = `02_make_univariate_tables.Rmd`

It creates the data frames `uni_all_df`, which contains all univariate results, and `uni_df`, which contains just the three features of interest.

**File** = `03_make_bivariate_tables.Rmd`

The following data frames are created.

* `bivar_EDvsME_df`: `EDVisits` versus `MaxPMExposure`
* `bivar_EDvsRE_df`: `EDVisits` versus `RoadwayExposure`
* `bivar_REvsME_df`: `RoadwayExposure` versus `MaxPMExposure`

**File**  `04_make_trivariate_table.Rmd`

It creates the data frame `tri_df`

## Validation of the tables

**File** `05_validate_tables.Rmd`

Some basic examination of marginal distributions to explore differences in results based on how the OpenAPI was programmed. 

## Statistical analysis

**File** = `06_statistical_analysis.Rmd`

Working on graphical displays to understand the content of the trivariate table. Also investigate possible models for significance testing.
